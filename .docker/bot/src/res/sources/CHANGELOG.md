## v0.1.2 (2014-10-12)

New Features:
  - EUR and CNY price feed added ( see updated readme with the new price feeds)
  - Added method getLastTrades in trade interface to return trades happened in the last 24 hours. Implemented for bter and ccedk.
  - New csv output with list of active orders at each time (refreshed when submitting liquidity info)
  - The bot creates a different folder for logs of each session

Improvements:
  - Refactored cryptopeg to secondary peg
  - All the percentages parameters are expressed in 0..100 scale
  - Default price increment changed from 0.001 to 0.0003 USD
  - The bot now shows a warning if the nubits wallet is locked
  - Refactored the secondary peg strategy for reduce code duplicates and improve readability
  - Graceful wall shift instead of resetting all orders, it now updates walls one at the time. Need more testing
  - Before timing out, try to clear orders again.
  - In HTML logging, "Trades" became "Warnings/Trades" to accommodate another category of messages.
  - Temporarily disabled the executed order aggregation function, made possible by ad additional parameter : aggegate (boolean) in the options. Now the proceeds from sales and buys are updated on price shift. For NBT/USD pair, the aggregation is still untouched.
  - Hipchat notifications for wall shifts


  Bug fixes:
  - Fixed the problem where the same custodian running multiple instance of the bot on different pair was overwriting the data. Now when sending RPC liquidity info, the bot sends an additional parameter with an unique identifier generated by combining custodian address with trading market and currency pair. Mike changed the client to aggregate info.
  - Fixed the bug that submitted liquidity info in the wrong unit for ccedk buy orders
  - Got rid of two important exit point that was causing the bot to quit in case of errors.
  - one price feed failing was displaying an error message, while now its just a regular warning.
  - It was required to run the secondary peg bot with at least 3 backup feeds, now its just two.
  - When checking existence of an order, do not return an error if its not found, show a warning instead.
  - A control prevented wallshifts to be saved on filesystem
  - Bter API errors sometime comes with boolean, sometime String . Patched the function handling errors .
